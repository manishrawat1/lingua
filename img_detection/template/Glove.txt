. Word vector algorithms use the context of the words to learn numerical representations for words, so that words used in the same context have similar looking word vectors.

we have to define and complete certain tasks. Hereâ€™s a high level list of these tasks.

    Create data tuples of the format [input word, output word], where each word is represented as one-hot vectors, from raw text
    Define a model that can take in the one-hot vectors as inputs and outputs, to be trained
    Define a loss function that predict the correct word, which is actually in the context of the input word, to optimize the model
    Evaluate the model by making sure similar words have similar word vectors
The advantage of GloVe is that, unlike Word2vec,
 GloVe does not rely just on local statistics (local context information of words), 
but incorporates global statistics (word co-occurrence) to obtain word vectors.
